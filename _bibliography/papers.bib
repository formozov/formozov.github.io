  abstract={Here, we present simultaneous fiber photometry recordings and optogenetic stimulation based on a multimode fused fiber coupler for both light delivery and collection without the need for dichroic beam splitters. In combination with a multi-color light source and appropriate optical filters, our approach offers remarkable flexibility in experimental design and facilitates the exploration of new molecular tools in vivo at minimal cost. We demonstrate straightforward re-configuration of the setup to operate with green, red, and near-infrared calcium indicators with or without simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and further explore the multi-color photometry capabilities of the system. The ease of assembly, operation, characterization, and customization of this platform holds the potential to foster the development of experimental strategies for multi-color fused fiber photometry combined with optogenetics far beyond its current state.}

  abstract={This study replicates and extends the work of Falk and Hermle (2018. “Relationship of Gender Differences in Preferences to Economic Development and Gender Equality.” Science 362 (6412): eaas9899), who hypothesized that gender differences in economic preferences (patience, altruism, willingness to take risks, negative and positive reciprocity, and trust) were related to economic development and gender equality. While we were able to replicate their main results, we found that a number of methodological choices called for reexamination. Specifically, the use of an ad hoc gender equality index built by the authors lacked systematic justification, which led us to employ solely well-established indexes from gender studies in the subsequent analysis. This new analysis confirmed a positive and statistically significant association between aggregated gender differences in economic preferences and economic development conditional on gender equality. However, in contrast to the original article, the evidence of the relationship between gender differences and gender equality conditional on economic development was weak. We also investigated the relationships for the separate economic preferences and found that economic development predicts gender differences in all six preferences, whereas gender equality seems to have a negligible or null influence on most of them. Our findings provide a more nuanced view of the gender differences in economic preferences, with possible implications for policy-making.}

  abstract={Expression of the immediate early gene cFos modifies the epigenetic landscape of activated neurons with downstream effects on synaptic plasticity. The production of cFos is inhibited by a long-lived isoform of another Fos family gene, ΔFosB. It has been speculated that this negative feedback mechanism may be critical for protecting episodic memories from being overwritten by new information. Here, we investigate the influence of ΔFosB inhibition on cFos expression and memory. Hippocampal neurons in slice culture produce more cFos on the first day of stimulation compared to identical stimulation on the following day. This downregulation affects all hippocampal subfields and requires histone deacetylation. Overexpression of ΔFosB in individual pyramidal neurons effectively suppresses cFos, indicating that accumulation of ΔFosB is the causal mechanism. Water maze training of mice over several days leads to accumulation of ΔFosB in granule cells of the dentate gyrus, but not in CA3 and CA1. Because the dentate gyrus is thought to support pattern separation and cognitive flexibility, we hypothesized that inhibiting the expression of ΔFosB would affect reversal learning, i.e., the ability to successively learn new platform locations in the water maze. The results indicate that pharmacological HDAC inhibition, which prevents cFos repression, impairs reversal learning, while learning and memory of the initial platform location remain unaffected. Our study supports the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms tightly regulate cFos expression in individual granule cells to orchestrate the formation of time-stamped memories.}

abstract = {Analysis of fluorescent signals in biological samples is widely used in the fields of life science and medicine and can be achieved through conceptually distinct approaches. Here, we report the use of a wideband multimode circulator (WMC), a three-port optical fused-fiber device with an asymmetrical structure specifically designed to ensure efficient light transmission in both illumination and collection paths. It features a flat spectral response and is ideally suited for simultaneous excitation and detection of fluorescence in biological tissue. The WMC used in this work was further improved by minimizing its inherent background autofluorescence. Using the WMC, we demonstrate improved fluorescence detection against already existing fiber-based approaches. Finally, we utilize the WMC to establish fiber photometry recordings in vivo to infer neuronal activity in a small neuromodulatory nucleus in the brainstem of an awake mouse.},
