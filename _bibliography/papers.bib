  abstract={General anesthesia is characterized by reversible loss of consciousness accompanied by transient amnesia. Yet, long-term memory impairment is an undesirable side effect. How different types of general anesthetics (GAs) affect the hippocampus, a brain region central to memory formation and consolidation, is poorly understood. Using extracellular recordings, chronic 2-photon imaging, and behavioral analysis, we monitor the effects of isoflurane (Iso), medetomidine/midazolam/fentanyl (MMF), and ketamine/xylazine (Keta/Xyl) on network activity and structural spine dynamics in the hippocampal CA1 area of adult mice. GAs robustly reduced spiking activity, decorrelated cellular ensembles, albeit with distinct activity signatures, and altered spine dynamics. CA1 network activity under all 3 anesthetics was different to natural sleep. Iso anesthesia most closely resembled unperturbed activity during wakefulness and sleep, and network alterations recovered more readily than with Keta/Xyl and MMF. Correspondingly, memory consolidation was impaired after exposure to Keta/Xyl and MMF, but not Iso. Thus, different anesthetics distinctly alter hippocampal network dynamics, synaptic connectivity, and memory consolidation, with implications for GA strategy appraisal in animal research and clinical settings.}

  abstract={Animals display selective escape behaviors when faced with environmental threats. Selection of the appropriate response by the underlying neuronal network is key to maximizing chances of survival, yet the underlying network mechanisms are so far not fully understood. Using synapse-level reconstruction of the Drosophila larval network paired with physiological and behavioral readouts, we uncovered a circuit that gates selective escape behavior for noxious light through acute and input-specific neuropeptide action. Sensory neurons required for avoidance of noxious light and escape in response to harsh touch, each converge on discrete domains of neuromodulatory hub neurons. We show that acute release of hub neuron-derived insulin-like peptide 7 (Ilp7) and cognate relaxin family receptor (Lgr4) signaling in downstream neurons are required for noxious light avoidance, but not harsh touch responses. Our work highlights a role for compartmentalized circuit organization and neuropeptide release from regulatory hubs, acting as central circuit elements gating escape responses.}

Thus, comprehensive analysis and efficient generalization require their description in various brain regions. Here we describe a large-scale, annotated collection of 2-photon calcium imaging data and multi-electrode, extracellular electrophysiological recordings in CA1 of the murine hippocampus under three distinct anesthetics (Isoflurane, Ketamine/Xylazine and Medetomidine/Midazolam/Fentanyl), during natural sleep, and wakefulness. We cover several aspects of data quality standardization and provide a set of tools for autonomous validation, along with analysis workflows for reuse and data exploration. The datasets described here capture various aspects of neural activity in hundreds of pyramidal cells at single cell resolution. In addition to relevance for basic biological research, the dataset may find utility in computational neuroscience as a benchmark for models of anesthesia and sleep.}

  abstract={Here, we present simultaneous fiber photometry recordings and optogenetic stimulation based on a multimode fused fiber coupler for both light delivery and collection without the need for dichroic beam splitters. In combination with a multi-color light source and appropriate optical filters, our approach offers remarkable flexibility in experimental design and facilitates the exploration of new molecular tools in vivo at minimal cost. We demonstrate straightforward re-configuration of the setup to operate with green, red, and near-infrared calcium indicators with or without simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and further explore the multi-color photometry capabilities of the system. The ease of assembly, operation, characterization, and customization of this platform holds the potential to foster the development of experimental strategies for multi-color fused fiber photometry combined with optogenetics far beyond its current state.}

  abstract={This study replicates and extends the work of Falk and Hermle (2018. “Relationship of Gender Differences in Preferences to Economic Development and Gender Equality.” Science 362 (6412): eaas9899), who hypothesized that gender differences in economic preferences (patience, altruism, willingness to take risks, negative and positive reciprocity, and trust) were related to economic development and gender equality. While we were able to replicate their main results, we found that a number of methodological choices called for reexamination. Specifically, the use of an ad hoc gender equality index built by the authors lacked systematic justification, which led us to employ solely well-established indexes from gender studies in the subsequent analysis. This new analysis confirmed a positive and statistically significant association between aggregated gender differences in economic preferences and economic development conditional on gender equality. However, in contrast to the original article, the evidence of the relationship between gender differences and gender equality conditional on economic development was weak. We also investigated the relationships for the separate economic preferences and found that economic development predicts gender differences in all six preferences, whereas gender equality seems to have a negligible or null influence on most of them. Our findings provide a more nuanced view of the gender differences in economic preferences, with possible implications for policy-making.},

abstract = {Analysis of fluorescent signals in biological samples is widely used in the fields of life science and medicine and can be achieved through conceptually distinct approaches. Here, we report the use of a wideband multimode circulator (WMC), a three-port optical fused-fiber device with an asymmetrical structure specifically designed to ensure efficient light transmission in both illumination and collection paths. It features a flat spectral response and is ideally suited for simultaneous excitation and detection of fluorescence in biological tissue. The WMC used in this work was further improved by minimizing its inherent background autofluorescence. Using the WMC, we demonstrate improved fluorescence detection against already existing fiber-based approaches. Finally, we utilize the WMC to establish fiber photometry recordings in vivo to infer neuronal activity in a small neuromodulatory nucleus in the brainstem of an awake mouse.},
